# Guess a Number Game
## Android Java Example

Here is my version of the Guess a Number game. This app generates a random number, prompts the user to make a guess, and gives helpful hints to the user. The user tries to guess the random number that was generated in the least amount of tries.

I have taught my [JavaSwift Academy](https://javaswiftacademy.com/) students how to code this simple app as a way to learn all of the basics of Android development. Feel free to download this Github project and play the game!
